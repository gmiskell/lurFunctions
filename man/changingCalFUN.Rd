\title{Calibration Interpolation Over Time.}
\usage{
changingCalFUN(x, obs, a1, b1, a2, b2)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{The column under investigation.}

\item{first.offset}{The intercept from the first calibration.}

\item{second.offset}{The intercept from the second calibration.}

\item{first.slope}{The slope from the first calibration.}

\item{second.slope}{The slope from the second calibration.}
}
\description{
A function for converting the linear coefficients over time to be weighted based on its proximity to one of the calibrations. The output is the corrected obs value.
